# SDCT-AuxNet^${\theta}$:DCT Augmented Stain Deconvolutional CNN with-Auxiliary Classifier for Cancer Diagnosis
The implementation of the paper SDCT-AuxNet$^{\theta}$: DCT Augmented Stain Deconvolutional CNN with Auxiliary Classifier for Cancer Diagnosis. The article is available [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S136184152030027X). The preprint of the article is also available [here.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.00304)


### The code has been tested with Python 2.7 and PyTorch 0.4.1

### Dataset:
The dataset for this article is available at [The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA)]( https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/C_NMC_2019+Dataset%3A+ALL+Challenge+dataset+of+ISBI+2019)


### Training
1. For training the the dataset directory should have the following structure:
<pre>
main_data_dir
|          -----------class1------subject_folders
|         |
fold0------
|         |
|          -----------class2------subject_folders
| 
|          -----------class1------subject_folders
|         |
fold1------
|         |
|          -----------class2------subject_folders 
|
|
.
.          -----------class1------subject_folders
.         |
foldn------
          |
           -----------class2------subject_folders
</pre>

2. Run train_model.py

### Evaluation
1. Run test_model.py
2. The performance of the model on the test set can be evaluated at the [challenge portal(https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/20395)
